# Differentiable Optimization-Based Modeling for Machine Learning

This repository contains the full source code and data to produce
[my thesis document](https://github.com/bamos/thesis/blob/master/bamos_thesis.pdf).
The BibTeX for this document is:

```
@phdthesis{amos2019differentiable,
  author       = {Brandon Amos},
  title        = {{Differentiable Optimization-Based Modeling for Machine Learning}},
  school       = {Carnegie Mellon University},
  year         = 2019,
  month        = 5,
}
```

+ This repository started from
  [Cyrus Omar's thesis code](https://github.com/cyrus-/thesis),
  which is based on a CMU thesis template
  by [David Koes](http://bits.csb.pitt.edu/)
  and others before.
+ Of standalone interest,
  [refs.sort.sh](https://github.com/bamos/thesis/blob/master/refs.sort.sh)
  uses biber to alphabetize and standardize my bibliography in
  [refs.bib](https://github.com/bamos/thesis/blob/master/refs.bib)
  so it doesn't get too messy.
  This uses the configuration in
  [refs.conf](https://github.com/bamos/thesis/blob/master/refs.conf).
